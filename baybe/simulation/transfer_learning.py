    """Simulate Bayesian optimization with transfer learning.

    A wrapper around :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios` that
    partitions the search space into its tasks and simulates each task with the training
    data from the remaining tasks.

    **NOTE:**
    Currently, the simulation only supports purely discrete search spaces. This is
    because ``lookup`` serves both as the loop-closing element **and** as the source
    for off-task training data. For continuous (or mixed) spaces, the lookup mechanism
    would need to be either implemented as a callable (in which case the training data
    must be provided separately) or the continuous parameters need to be effectively
    restricted to the finite number of provided lookup configurations. Neither is
    implemented at the moment.

    Args:
        campaign: See :func:`baybe.simulation.core.simulate_experiment`.
        lookup: See :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`.
        batch_size: See :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`.
        n_doe_iterations: See :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`.
        groupby: See :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`.
        n_mc_iterations: See :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`.

    Returns:
        A dataframe as returned by :func:`baybe.simulation.scenarios.simulate_scenarios`
        where the different tasks are represented in the ``Scenario`` column.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If a non-discrete search space is chosen.
